###Bonus Task
Im not quit sure if I got the correct phaser int (parameter). I could have done it like in task 2. But since the code from the task didn't even use the 
parameter (which I found required) and it wasn't any TODO over the implementation I didn't want ot do it like that. Pls explain to me if this should be done any different.
